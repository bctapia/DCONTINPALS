# pyDCONTINPALS

Copyright (c) 2020-2021 Danny Petschke (danny.petschke@uni-wuerzburg.de). All rights reserved.<br><br>
<b>pyDCONTINPALS</b> - A program in Python for running the historical FORTRAN code CONTIN-PALS initially provided by [Provencher (1982)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0010465582901746) and [Gregory et al. (1990/](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016890029090358D)[1991)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016890029190367Y). CONTIN-PALS program solves Fredholm integral equations with convoluted exponential decays as kernels of the type that occur in the analysis of Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectra (PALS).<br>

# Quickstart Guide

`pyDCONTINPALS` consists of 3 files ...<br>

`pyDCONTINPALS.py`<br>
`pyDCONTINPALSInput.py`<br>
`pyDCONTINPALSSpecSimulator.py`<br>

* <b>edit</b> the input file `pyDCONTINPALSInput.py`:

```python
__demoMode                  = True # disable if running from real data

# NOTE: spectrum and IRF (or mono-exponential decay spectrum e.g. 207-Bi) data vectors require equal length!

# file path (and name) to the SPECTRUM data:
__filePathSpec              = 'testData/spectrum_10ps.dat'
__specDataDelimiter         = '\t'

# file path (and name) to the IRF data:
__filePathRefOrIRFSpec      = 'testData/ref_10ps.dat'
__refDataDelimiter          = '\t'

# define the number of rows, which should be skipped during the import (e.g. for ignoring the header entries):
__skipRows                  = 5;

# fixed mono-decay component in units of picoseconds [ps] (1/lambda = tau):
# Note: set to something like 1E-6 if you provide numerical IRF data as input such as recorded from 60-Co
__tau_monoDecaySpec_in_ps   = 182.0  #[ps]

# grid of characteristic lifetimes with equally distributed grid points defining the resulting intensity spectrum
__gridTau_start             = 50.0   # [ps]
__gridTau_stop              = 3000.0 # [ps]
__gridPoints                = 100    # 10 ... 100 Note: this value is internally limited to 100 by CONTIN

# channel/bin resolution [ps]
__channelResolutionInPs     = 50.0  # >= 10 ... Note: this value is internally limited by CONTIN

# background estimation:
__bkgrd_startIndex          = 800;
__bkgrd_count               = 190; # number of channels with respect to the 'startIndex'
```
* <b>execute</b> `pyDCONTINPALS.py`<br>

* <b>finished</b>. You should see the results as shown above in the figures when running in the demo mode <i>(__demoMode = True)</i>.
